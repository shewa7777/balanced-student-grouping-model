# Balanced Student Grouping Model

This project solves a group allocation problem using decision modelling techniques in Excel. The goal was to form balanced student groups based on the following criteria:

- Gender
- Quantitative background
- Cultural background and nationality
- Group size (ideal: 5 students per group)

The model supports fair and diverse group formation for coursework or collaborative learning and reflects the kind of decision-making often needed in academic or organizational settings.
